For all his pranks, crimes and scheming that left the entire village in shambles and a nearly torn off limb, he was exiled and left to die.\n\nIn his absence, Melunia and her people had finally known better days, but their time of tranquility would not last long as their neighboring village has sent them a convoy of half-dead villagers. The cause of death? Magical Frostbite.\n\nThis is only the beginning of the tale of Xelgium, the arrogant young hunter exiled for his crimes, Marianne, the merciful cleric who rescues him, and the re-emergence of horrors from the legends of the war six decades ago."
